A demo project that I use to experiment with.

Please run using Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1 Canary 4, otherwise I cannot guarantee it will run without any errors

Currently includes:

 - [AffectedModuleDetector](https://github.com/dropbox/AffectedModuleDetector) plugin to:
    1. Compare changes from current branch and origin/master
    2. Run unit/ui tests for those modules only on CI with every push
 - Hilt
 - Modularization
 - Jetpack Compose
